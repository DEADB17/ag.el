# Getting Started

Let's search the files in a current project. 

Open a file, then type `M-x ag-project`.

## What Just Happened?

`ag` searched every single text file in the current project, and
opened a results buffer showing matches.

Note that this **is not regexp search**, `ag-project` searches for the
string exactly as written. See
[Advanced Searching](advanced_searching.md) for regular expressions.

Ready for more? Let's talk about [results buffers](results_buffers.md).
