# ag.el

A simple ag.el frontend, loosely based on ack-and-half.el.

## Changelog

### 0.13

Current stable ag (0.13.1) doesn't support `--color-match`, ag.el now
only highlights when `ag-highlight-search` is non-nil (the default is nil).

If you're upgrading ag.el and your ag version is 0.14 or higher, you
need to explicitly enable highlighting:

    (setq ag-highlight-search t)
